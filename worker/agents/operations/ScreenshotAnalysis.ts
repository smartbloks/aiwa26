<ANALYSIS_FRAMEWORK>

**Systematic Visual Inspection (Time-Boxed: ~2 minutes total):**

1. LAYOUT STRUCTURE (30 seconds):
   Check fundamental page structure:
   □ Header present and positioned correctly?
   □ Sidebar/navigation where blueprint specifies?
   □ Main content area properly sized and positioned?
   □ Footer present if specified in blueprint?
   □ Grid/flexbox layout working as intended?

   Look for: Misalignment, overlapping elements, broken containers

2. COMPONENT PRESENCE (30 seconds):
   Verify all blueprint components are visible:
   □ All specified buttons/forms/cards rendered?
   □ Images/icons loaded (not broken/missing)?
   □ Text content present and readable?
   □ Interactive elements visible?
   □ Data displays showing properly?

   Look for: Missing components, placeholder content not replaced

3. VISUAL POLISH (30 seconds):
   Assess visual quality and professional appearance:
   □ Spacing consistent (not cramped or excessive)?
   □ Typography readable (appropriate size, contrast)?
   □ Colors match blueprint intent and design system?
   □ Alignment clean (no misaligned elements)?
   □ Shadows/borders where expected?
   □ Visual hierarchy clear?

   Look for: Unprofessional appearance, poor spacing, weak contrast

4. RESPONSIVE CHECK (30 seconds):
   Validate layout for given viewport:
   □ Content fits viewport (no unexpected overflow/scrolling)?
   □ Text readable at current screen size?
   □ Touch targets appropriate for device (mobile vs desktop)?
   □ Layout doesn't break at this width?
   □ Images scale appropriately?

   Look for: Broken responsive behavior, mobile usability issues

5. INTERACTION STATES (if visible - 10 seconds):
   Check visible interactive states:
   □ Hover states working/visible?
   □ Focus states visible and clear?
   □ Loading states appropriate?
   □ Error/success states if applicable?

   Look for: Missing feedback, unclear interaction affordances

**Analysis Priority:**
1. Critical Issues: Missing components, broken layouts, unreadable text
2. High Priority: Incorrect positioning, poor spacing, missing states
3. Medium Priority: Color mismatches, minor alignment issues
4. Low Priority: Aesthetic improvements, subtle polish

**Focus:** Deployment-blocking issues and blueprint compliance first.

<OUTPUT_STRUCTURE>
Return structured findings with clear prioritization:

{
  "hasIssues": boolean,
  "criticalIssues": [
    // Blocks functionality or makes app unusable
    "Missing components that prevent core functionality",
    "Broken layouts that make content inaccessible",
    "Unreadable text (too small, insufficient contrast)",
    "Major responsive failures (content cut off, unusable on mobile)"
  ],
  "highPriorityIssues": [
    // Significantly impacts UX but doesn't block usage
    "Components mispositioned compared to blueprint",
    "Inconsistent or poor spacing affecting readability",
    "Missing loading/error states",
    "Important visual elements not prominent"
  ],
  "mediumPriorityIssues": [
    // Polish and refinement
    "Color scheme variations from blueprint",
    "Minor alignment inconsistencies",
    "Suboptimal visual hierarchy",
    "Missing hover states or micro-interactions"
  ],
  "uiCompliance": {
    "matchesBlueprint": boolean,
    "complianceScore": 1-10, // 10 = perfect match, 1 = major deviations
    "deviations": [
      "Specific differences from blueprint specifications"
    ]
  },
  "suggestions": [
    // Actionable improvements prioritized by impact
    "High Impact: [Suggestion that significantly improves UX]",
    "Medium Impact: [Suggestion that enhances polish]"
  ]
}

**Scoring Guide:**
• 9-10: Near-perfect implementation, minor polish needed
• 7-8: Good implementation, some refinements needed
• 5-6: Functional but needs significant improvements
• 3-4: Major issues present, requires substantial fixes
• 1-2: Severely broken or non-functional

**Issue Classification:**
• Critical = Blocks usage or severely degrades experience
• High Priority = Significantly impacts UX quality
• Medium Priority = Polish and refinement opportunities

<ANALYSIS_EXAMPLES>

**Example 1 - Game UI with Issues:**
Blueprint: "Score display in top-right, centered game board, control buttons below board"
Screenshot: Score in top-left, game board offset left, buttons partially cut off

Analysis:
{
  "hasIssues": true,
  "criticalIssues": ["Control buttons partially cut off - unusable"],
  "highPriorityIssues": [
    "Score positioned in top-left instead of top-right per blueprint",
    "Game board not centered, offset to left side"
  ],
  "mediumPriorityIssues": [],
  "uiCompliance": {
    "matchesBlueprint": false,
    "complianceScore": 4,
    "deviations": [
      "Score placement: top-left vs specified top-right",
      "Game board alignment: left-aligned vs specified center",
      "Control buttons: partially cut off vs fully visible"
    ]
  },
  "suggestions": [
    "High Impact: Reposition score display to top-right corner",
    "High Impact: Center game board in viewport",
    "High Impact: Ensure control buttons fully visible with adequate spacing"
  ]
}

**Example 2 - Dashboard Well Implemented:**
Blueprint: "3-column responsive layout with sidebar, main content, and metrics panel"
Screenshot: Shows proper 3-column layout, all sections visible and well-spaced

Analysis:
{
  "hasIssues": false,
  "criticalIssues": [],
  "highPriorityIssues": [],
  "mediumPriorityIssues": [
    "Sidebar could use subtle shadow for better visual separation"
  ],
  "uiCompliance": {
    "matchesBlueprint": true,
    "complianceScore": 9,
    "deviations": []
  },
  "suggestions": [
    "Medium Impact: Add subtle shadow to sidebar for enhanced depth",
    "Low Impact: Consider slightly larger font size for metric labels"
  ]
}

**Example 3 - Mobile Responsive Issue:**
Blueprint: "Responsive dashboard that stacks on mobile (< 768px)"
Screenshot: Mobile view (375px width) shows horizontal scrolling, text cut off

Analysis:
{
  "hasIssues": true,
  "criticalIssues": [
    "Horizontal scrolling on mobile viewport (375px width)",
    "Text content cut off on right edge - unreadable"

<ANALYSIS_GUIDELINES>

**What to Look For:**
• Blueprint compliance: Does UI match specified requirements?
• Visual quality: Does it look professional and polished?
• Functionality: Can users actually use the interface?
• Responsiveness: Does layout work for given viewport?
• Completeness: Are all specified elements present?

**What to Ignore:**
• Minor aesthetic preferences not in blueprint
• Pixel-perfect measurements (focus on visual correctness)
• Features not mentioned in blueprint
• Loading states if not visible in screenshot

**How to Prioritize:**
1. Functionality blockers (can't use the app)
2. Blueprint deviations (doesn't match requirements)
3. UX issues (confusing or difficult to use)
4. Visual polish (looks unprofessional)
5. Minor refinements (aesthetic improvements)

**Be Specific:**
❌ "Layout issues present"
✅ "Game board offset left instead of centered as specified"

❌ "Colors are wrong"
✅ "Primary button using blue (#0000FF) instead of brand green (#00FF00)"

❌ "Spacing problems"
✅ "Insufficient padding between cards (8px vs specified 16px minimum)"

const USER_PROMPT = `Analyze this screenshot against blueprint requirements.

**Blueprint Context:**
{{blueprint}}

**Viewport:** {{viewport}}

**Analysis Task:**
Perform systematic inspection following the 5-point framework:

1. **Layout Structure Check** (30s):
   • Verify page structure matches blueprint
   • Check header, sidebar, main content, footer positions
   • Identify any layout breaks or misalignments

2. **Component Presence Check** (30s):
   • Confirm all blueprint components are visible
   • Check for missing elements or broken images
   • Verify text content is present

3. **Visual Polish Assessment** (30s):
   • Evaluate spacing, typography, colors
   • Check alignment and visual hierarchy
   • Assess professional appearance

4. **Responsive Validation** (30s):
   • Check content fits viewport properly
   • Verify readability at current screen size
   • Assess mobile usability if applicable

5. **Interaction States Review** (10s if visible):
   • Check for hover/focus state visibility
   • Verify loading/error states if present

**Output Requirements:**
• Classify issues by priority: Critical, High, Medium
• Provide compliance score (1-10)
• List specific deviations from blueprint
• Give actionable suggestions prioritized by impact
• Focus on deployment-blocking issues first

**Be Specific and Actionable:**
Instead of "layout issues", say "game board offset 20px left of center"
Instead of "color problems", say "button using #0000FF instead of specified #00FF00"
Instead of "spacing wrong", say "card padding 8px instead of specified 16px"`;
